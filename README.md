## Move Mouse Pointer using AT Switch/Buttons

The Windows Mouse Keys feature lets the user move the mouse pointer using
the numeric keypad keys. The XAC can send keyboard key presses including
the numeric keypad keys. Combining these features allows the user to
move the mouse pointer using AT switches/buttons plugged into the XAC.
